   Introductions:

The Boston Housing Dataset is a classic dataset widely used in machine learning, particularly for regression tasks. It provides a set of features describing housing values in different neighborhoods in Boston, Massachusetts, and is commonly used to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes based on various factors.

Purpose: The dataset is used to predict the median value of homes in Boston, making it ideal for regression models.

Context: The data originates from the 1970 U.S. Census and was collected for studying factors that affect home prices in different areas of Boston.

Size: The dataset consists of 506 samples (data points), with 14 variables in total, including 13 features and one target variable.
